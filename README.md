 Project On Automated Teller Machine(ATM)

In this Project I have created an ATM machine in which we can login using our account number and password(it can be alphabetic or alphanumeric).

All the customers data has been stored in mySQL database that is secured only developers can update the data.

The idea behind is there will be more security by adding this alphanumric password and there will be no requirement of physical card.
